# JavaCa1

## Workload Distribution
- we split the workload evenly throughout the entire project, and helped each other on a lot of code
- however, each of us are responsible for our own system

| Gabriel | Darren |
|---------|--------|
| Student Admin System | Student Enquiry System |

## Additional Features
- Pagination functionality whenm displaying students
- Comprehensive login system, following model-view-controller format
- error handling for all user input

## Challenges Faced
- first coding project that required us to work in a group
- we spent a lot of time setting up Git to work on Netbeans and encountered a lot of problems along the way
- took a lot of time to discuss how the system would work in a way both of us would be satisfied
- time constraints
- as we weren't able to meet-up everyday of the holiday due to our own personal commitments, it was difficult to find time for these discussions
- learning new java concepts and apply these concepts into our project (eg integrating inheritance to create custom errors)

## Set-up
- download file from master branch
- open folder as project in apache netbeans (other ide might work, but the program was made for netbeans)
- right-click and run userMenu.java file
